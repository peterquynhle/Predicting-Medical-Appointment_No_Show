This project is to review ML model building in predicting medical appointment no-shows

1. Business Problem/Question
- No-shows are preventable waste of limited healthcare resources
- Can we predict someone who is likely to no-show at an appointment?

2. Objective
- Find the best ML model in predicting no-shows among medical appointments using historical dataset of of 300k medical appointments available on Kaggle

3. Ref:  
- Data: Kaggle.com
- Code ref: https://github.com/TCSS-555-Machine-Learning/No-Show-Prediction and https://github.com/munozalexander/NoShow-Prediction
